                "overview": "Frequent travelers may be interested in the American Express Blue Sky card's rewards programs. Its points program allows frequent spenders to earn points that translate to monetary credits that can be used toward any\n      airline ticket, hotel stay or car rental. Perks like complimentary hotel breakfasts are also available during weekend stays at some hotels, as well are some discounts. Though there is introductory APR of 0%, users should consider the card's basic\n      APR and balance transfer APR when considering whether this is a good match for them - as with most credit cards, it's best not to carry high balances from month to month. Late fees range from $19 to $39.",

                "rates": "For the 12-month intro period, this card carries a 0% interest APR on purchases, after which point an APR will kick in contingent upon your individual credit score.",
                "benefits": "The card offers no annual fee and no interest on purchases for up to six months. Other benefits include the possibility of extending purchase warranties and some return protections under certain conditions. When staying at JW Marriott\n      and Renaissance Hotels and Resorts on weekends, this card entitles you to complimentary breakfast and $100 off your next stay. Car rental loss and damage insurance, and travel accident insurance is also available, as well as access to a \u201cglobal assist\u201d\n      hotline.",

The READYdebit Prepaid Visa Card is a useful tool if you want a more secure spending option than cash, but don't have access to credit, or don't want to use a credit card.\n\nYou're eligible for this card regardless of your credit situation, even if you have no credit.  All you have to do is load the card with money, and it's ready to go.\n\nThis card won't help you build credit, since your spending and payment activity on a prepaid debit card are not reported to the credit bureaus.  But it does provide a secure spending alternative to cash, and you won't be charged interest on your purchases. And because it's a prepaid card, you won't be able to spend over your \"limit\" - which is the amount you have on deposit.",
                "rewards": "No rewards apply.",
                "credit-standing": "The READYdebit Prepaid Visa Card is open to anyone, regardless of their credit history. Consumers with no established credit can also secure this card.",
                "balance-transfers": "Balance transfers do not apply.",
                "rates": "Expect to pay a one-time set-up fee of $9.95, then a monthly service fee of $9.95 - which among other things, allows you free PIN transactions and balance inquiries.\n\nYou have unlimited access to automated customer service.  If you want to talk to a live customer service representative, it's free one time per month; after the initial free monthly call, it's $2 per call.",
                "benefits": "When you set up your account online, you have the option of setting up direct deposit or bank transfers, free of charge.  You can also choose to load it at participating retail stores such as Wal-Mart, Walgreens, Rite Aid or anywhere you see the Visa ReadyLink logo.\n\nThere are no overdraft fees or bounced check fees with the READYdebit Prepaid Visa Card.  You can also send money from one card to another for free, and you can use it for online bill-paying.\n\nIn terms of security, the money you load onto the card is FDIC-insured, and your purchases are covered by Visa Zero Fraud Liability protection.",
                "who-should-apply": "Anyone that would prefer the convenience of paying with a credit card but not the high fees and interest rates that usually accompany such a card.  It's also a great option for consumers that are unable to open a checking account or have very poor credit. In fact, consumers with all types of credit, including no credit, are eligible for this card.",

With the AccountNow Gold Visa Prepaid Card, you get the convenience of a traditional credit card without the added risk of going into debt. Simply determine the amount of cash you'd like to add and load your card online or via direct deposit.",
                "overview": "Many Americans frustrated with high annual percentage rates and confusing terms and conditions opt for the benefits of prepaid products over traditional credit cards. If this sounds like you, the AccountNow Gold Visa Prepaid Card may just have your name on it. The prepaid card allows you to load cash onto it online or via direct deposit, ensuring that you won't exceed a monthly limit or incur high fees.",
                "rewards": "Though no special deals or incentives apply to the AccountNow Gold Visa, customers will benefit from convenient access to online services and free bill pay.",
                "credit-standing": "Similar to most prepaid cards, the AccountNow Gold Visa does not require a credit check, allowing anyone to open an account regardless of their credit score.",

                "rates": "The AccountNow Gold Visa does carry some fees, but annual percentage rates do not apply. There is no application fee, but cardholders will be charged a $2.50 fee each time they make an ATM withdrawal. Account holders will also be subject to a $9.95 one-time Gold Privilege fee the first time they load money to their card. Users may also be charged a $9.95 monthly usage fee; however, this fee will be waived for those who load $3,000 or more on to their prepaid product in one month.",
                "benefits": "The AccountNow Gold Visa removes the hassle of lengthly application processes and credit checks. Cardholders can also spend the amount loaded onto their card without the fear of incurring large amounts of interest charges or fees and penalties. The prepaid card provides the benefits of a debit card by allowing users to withdraw funds via ATM - for a small fee - but carries the traditional fraud liability protections of a conventional credit card.",

This card is typical of student-geared credit cards in that the APR is higher, so it's best to pay your balance in full each month or keep it to a minimum.
